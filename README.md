## Project 1: [Social Media Ads Targeting Strategy Analysis](https://github.com/jacobdbt2100/Social-Media-Ads-Targeting-Strategy-Analysis/blob/main/README.md)
This project analyses social media advertisement performance to understand how different demographic groups respond to campaigns. The goal is to identify the audience segments that deliver the highest engagement and conversions relative to spend, and to highlight where targeting adjustments can improve efficiency.

## Project 2: [Manufacturing Downtime Analysis](https://github.com/jacobdbt2100/Manufacturing-Downtime-Analysis/blob/main/README.md)

Using Power Query and Power BI, I analyzed soda bottling production line data and found that downtime caused a 36% inefficiency, extending batch duration by 23 hours. Operator errors were the leading drivers. Five factors–mainly machine adjustments, machine failure, and inventory shortage amongst others–accounted for 80% of total downtime. Base on these findings, I recommended targeted operator training, improved maintenance schedules, real-time inventory tracking, and high-downtime equipment upgrades to boost operational efficiency.
